### [ThreeBlox]({{ base.url }}/threeblox/)

* Built a block dodging web game using [**Three.js**](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
* Reused a base set of 3000 blocks and recalculated their position as the player passes them, in
order to increase efficiency by reducing object allocations.
* Implemented a simple collision detection algorithm to check when the player collides with a block,
and to prevent two blocks from overlapping.

### [Pacman]({{ base.url }}/pacman/) [[Source Code](https://github.com/DylanDavidson/pong)]

* Recreated Pacman in 3D using [**Three.js**](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
* Implemented a 3rd person tracking camera, and a smaller minimap

### [Pong]({{ base.url }}/pong/) [[Source Code](https://github.com/DylanDavidson/pong)]

* Recreated the classic game Pong as a 3D browser game using [**Three.js**](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
* Implemented three simple AI difficulties and particle explosions when a player scores.

### [Angry Spheres]({{ base.url }}/angryspheres/) [[Source Code](https://github.com/DylanDavidson/angryspheres)]

* Recreated the popular game Angry Birds as a 3D browser game using [**Three.js**](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

### Swapd

* Built a marketplace for UCF students to buy and sell textbooks using the **Ruby on Rails**
web framework with a friend.

* Highlighted matching text in search results as detailed in my [blog post]({% post_url 2015-03-19-highlighting-search-results-with-jquery %}).
* Integrated with the **Google Books API** to pull ISBNs and other book information to prefill the
textbook posting form.
